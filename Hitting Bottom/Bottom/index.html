                <color id="red" >Our love</color> still young, our marriage new, Robert and I felt blackness as a second vow, 
                a spiritual seal between two souls who spent long years before we met wondering if we would ever find each other. 
                Now we were one and would soon bring a life into  being. A new beautiful life, a black life, 
                we would love and bring into the Fells family. <size id="big">Irene’s sibling, a new Negro beginning.</size>
                Robert left on assignment to write about Liberia, a foothold in the motherland. He died at sea. Pneumonia. 
                The last letter he wrote to me said Africa doesn’t want us. Garvey was in  prison for fraud (faked charges). 
                I was carrying the child I wanted to share with Robert. Roberta came early. Grief was our midwife. 
                God must hate Negroes. <a href="#" class="dead-link" >Why does God make our luck so bad? She lived ten days.</a> Is this the worst? 
                Is worse coming? What is the point of making art? Flowers on graves? Dancing in masks to placate death? 
                I don’t want it. I don’t want art. Take the gift back. With everything else.
